                    cats and finding them
                    a
                    new home and loving owners.</p>
                <p class="flow-text">In our country, there are very few shelters for cats. There are more than 500 cats
                    in Murkoshâ€™s
                    private
                    shelter, according to this indicator we are the largest private shelter. The vast majority of
                    animals
                    brought there by good people or former owners. Cats are very different - affectionate and not very,
                    wayward, fearful, playful, sad, funny. And the all-all is very beautiful!</p>
                <p class="flow-text">All shelter orphans dream of one thing - to find their home and loving owners.
                </p>
                <p class="flow-text">We are their only chance to survive and find a new life. Unfortunately, in our
                    country, people are
                    afraid
                    to take cats from shelters. Anyone can save the animal from the shelter and give him a new life,
                    warmth,
                    affection, attention! Believe me, animals will not remain in debt. They will give you their soul,
                    heart
                    and become your most loyal friends!</p>
